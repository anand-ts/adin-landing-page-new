## ADIN Landing Page - Technical Decisions & Strategy

### Project Summary
Multi-page landing site for ADIN. Built with Next.js 15 and Tailwind CSS. Delivers targeted experiences for investors, members, and founders.

## Architecture Decisions

I chose the Next.js 15 App Router to build distinct, high-conversion experiences for our three core audiences: investors, members, and founders. This architecture maps URL routes like `/investors` and `/founders` to dedicated page structures. The result is a targeted user journey where investors see deal flow interfaces and founders get fundraising calculators. Each audience receives precisely the tools they need.

To maintain design consistency and accelerate development, I adopted a strict utility-first methodology with Tailwind CSS. This approach eliminated style variations by enforcing a predefined design system for spacing, color, and typography. It also streamlined our design review process, cutting iterations and ensuring a cohesive look across all pages, regardless of which developer built them.

My component model balances brand consistency with targeted messaging. I built a set of unified components, like `UnifiedCTA` and `UnifiedFAQ`, to enforce brand standards globally. For audience-specific needs, I use tailored components like `FoundersHero` to deliver customized content. This hybrid strategy allows for rapid, scalable development while ensuring every user interaction is both on-brand and highly relevant.

## Technical Snapshot

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Utility-First)
- **Hosting**: Vercel

### Key Decisions
- **Rendering**: I chose Server-Side Generation (SSG) for optimal SEO and fast initial loads, accepting the need for client-side hydration for interactive elements.
- **Performance**: I prioritized performance with a target bundle size under 100KB, CSS-first animations, and `next/image` for optimization. Advanced animations are deferred.
- **Components**: I implemented a hybrid model, using unified components like `UnifiedCTA` for brand consistency and page-specific components like `FoundersHero` for targeted messaging.

### Development Roadmap
My immediate focus is on implementing core infrastructure, including contact forms and event tracking. Following that, I will enhance the UI with page transitions and scroll-triggered animations, while also improving the codebase with component documentation and error boundaries.

### Security & Performance
The application is built with a strong security foundation, including HTTPS enforcement and input sanitization. Performance is a priority, with automated optimizations like code splitting and image lazy loading. The infrastructure is monitored for performance and security vulnerabilities.
